        <p class="English-Paragraphs">Being able to speak two or more languages is something that can literally change you and give you a distinct advantage in a very competitive world. Plus, it’s really a whole lot of fun!</p>

        <p class="English-Paragraphs">At Bilingauling, we have the bilingual books that you—or anyone else—want to become more proficient in another language, need to practice and get better. And we all know that practice makes perfect!</p>

        <p class="English-Paragraphs">The books that we offer here at Bilingauling are an excellent, interesting and fun way to practice a second language. We take timeless classics that are loved around the world, translate them and then align and format them for easy reading in two languages.</p>

        <p class="English-Paragraphs">So listen, if you want to truly open up doors to a new world and develop a skill that will serve you well throughout your life, just start reading!</p>

        <p class="English-Paragraphs">This eBook is arranged into two sections: the complete French text at the beginning of the book and the complete English text following afterward. The paragraphs in both texts are numbered, so you can easily look up the English parallel of any paragraph that you are reading. Simply click on the French paragraph’s number. After you have reviewed the parallel text in English, simply click the >>Back link at the end of that paragraph to continue reading the story from where you left off. Whatever your level of reading proficiency, click on each and every paragraph or click on only those paragraphs that you need help in brushing up on your language skills. You control how and what you want to read. What could be easier?</p>

        <p class="English-Paragraphs">Ciao!</p>
