                        The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she thought, 'and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there. 'That's the judge,' she said to herself, 'because of his great wig.'<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        'And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, 'and those twelve creatures,' (she was obliged to say 'creatures,' you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) 'I suppose they are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, 'jury-men' would have done just as well.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 'What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon.

                        Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down 'stupid things!' on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell 'stupid,' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. 'A nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!' thought Alice.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>
