                        'Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        'Oh, I beg your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; 'not that it signifies much,' she said to herself; 'I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        'That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: 'Unimportant, your Majesty means, of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        'Unimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, 'important--unimportant-- unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word sounded best.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        Some of the jury wrote it down 'important,' and some 'unimportant.'
