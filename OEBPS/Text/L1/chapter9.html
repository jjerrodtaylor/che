                        Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. 'When I'm a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone though), 'I won't have any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, 'and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know--'<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.

                        Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.

'Come, that's a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>

                        They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) 'Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, 'and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.<a href="../L2/chapter2.html#back-targ-2-31"><span class="back-carrots">&lt;&lt;</span>Back</a>
